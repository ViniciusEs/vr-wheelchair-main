<br/>

VR Wheelchair is a wheelchair locomotion rig for virtual reality applications built in Unity. The rig is layered closely on top of Unity's [XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@1.0/manual/index.html) to provide cross-platform compatibility. The package contains a complete player controller rig (based on Unity's "Room-Scale XR Rig (Action-based)") which can be easily imported as a prefab into an existing Unity project.

VR Wheelchair is motivated to iterate on one of VR's looming design problems - locomotion - as well as to utilize VR's immersiveness to build empathy for other forms of embodiment.

You can read more about the project's key motivations, as well as my development process, in the [project devlog](https://justinmajetich.medium.com/vr-wheelchair-devlog-ce51023c1b00).


## Features

### Current

- Physics-based controller rig.
- Unique 3D wheelchair model.

### Furture

- Haptic and audio feedback systems.
- Dynamic braking using value-based input vs. binary input.
- Rig/model scalability to allow a custom fit for variable body sizes.

## Release

VR Wheelchair is still in prototype, but I'm projecting a version 1.0 release on the Unity Asset Store early summer 2021.

## Demo

You can demo a prototype version of the VR Wheelchair rig on your Oculus Quest: [Download APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JvLnPTRQp6nLgtoKSW6U6pl9jDtZysRV/view?usp=sharing)

Install to your Quest using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto) or Android's [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).
